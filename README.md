# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service) using machine learning classification techniques. It analyzes customer behavior and demographic patterns to help businesses proactively retain users.

---

## Objective

To build a predictive model that classifies customers as **Churned** or **Not Churned**, using features related to customer usage, demographics, and services.

 **Target Variable**: "Churn"

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering and Encoding  
4. Model Building using classification algorithms  
5. Model Evaluation and Comparison  
6. Final Model Selection
